			<h2>BCH Mining Information</h2>
			<p>BCH mining is the process of verifying transactions on the Bitcoin Cash network and adding them to the blockchain. Miners are rewarded with newly minted BCH for their work.</p>
			<p>To mine BCH, you need to connect to a mining pool using your mining hardware. The mining pool will provide you with work to do, and you will submit your completed work to the pool for verification.</p>
			<p>When mining BCH, it's important to consider the mining difficulty, as well as the current block reward and block time. These factors can affect the profitability of your mining operation.</p>
